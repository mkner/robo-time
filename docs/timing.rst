.. py:mod: 
.. py:mod:: py_mod

.. function:: delay(delay_time)

    initiates a delay for an amount of time in milliseconds
    and is an equivilent to the arduino delay function
    underlying timing mechanism  uses the most accurate, 
    valid monotonic time that only goes forward in time

  :param delay_time: amount of time to delay (milliseconds)

  :return: None
