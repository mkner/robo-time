**Motivation**


This project evolved in the course of designing and implementing an OS for mobile robotics. In particular, small differential drive robots. These robots are both individual mobile robots and interactive robots in a dynamic distributed mobile environment.

Mobile robots exist in the continuous cycle of modes of See, Think and Do. Of necessity, there are ongoing questions a mobile robot needs to answer:

Where am I? What do I see? What am I doing? What am I going to do? Where do I go? How do I get there? When do I get there? Then what? And What next? 

And for every motion oriented task, the starting point always goes back to the fundamentals: perception of the environment and localization in that environment.

Perception is based on continuous measurements and readings from electronic, electro-mechanical, electro-optical and possibly electro-chemical devices. These sensors measure various aspects of the environment, both external and internal. Mobile robotic perception starts at this interface.

The interpretation of incoming measurements and their associated events have one thing in common. They all depend on some representation of time, absolute time, relative time and time synchronization.
