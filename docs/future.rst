Clock
*****

Clock is a fundamental uptime device. Its intrinsic 
concept of the partitioning of forward moving discrete time
units is calendar like with days, months, years.

The seconds, minutes, hours and days are in earth standard units.
A minute has 60 seconds, an hour has 60 minutes and a day has 24 hours.
The future class derived from Clock will handle uptime calendar-like
partitioning with other divisions of days and also days in a year 
and months in a year better suited for the UptimeClock to be used
as a mission uptime clock in other worlds, planets, realms of space
where days have more or less than 24 hours and years have more or less
than 3approximately 65 days. Thses are both based on rotational rates.
