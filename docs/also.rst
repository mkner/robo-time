For another must have robotic python package see...

A Robotic Utility Function Toolkit aka simply **roboutils**

This small toolkit contains mapping, bounding, ranging, trigonmetric conversion
and velocity functions for the development of autonomous mobile robotic software
and systems that are frequently needed and convenient to have in one place

Documentation is `here <https://robo-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

To use the toolkit, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install robo-utils

The main python package download site is: `here <https://pypi.org/project/robo-utils/>`_


And for robotic motion and device control see...

**BasicPID** -- a Python PID Controller designed to handle the combined kinematic 
and dynamic complexity of mobile robotics. The controller implements timestep integration
that can be used in discretized time regulators.  Deployed in actual mobile robotic systems, the 
PID controller design has proven to be tested and reliable for the dynamic balance and rapid 
response required for differential drive linear and lateral wheeled motion control. 

This PID controller has been fairly popular with thousands of downloads since its release.

Documentation is `here <https://robo-pid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

To use the PID controller, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install basic-pid
