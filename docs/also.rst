For another must have robotic python package see...

A Robotic Utility Function Toolkit aka simply **roboutils**
Maybe it might end up being called ARUFT anyway!

Documentation is `here <https://robo-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

To use the toolkit, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install robo-utils

The main python package download site is: `here <https://pypi.org/project/robo-utils/>`_

And for motion and robotic device control see...

**RoboPID** -- a Python PID Controller designed to handle the combined kinematic 
and dynamic complexity of mobile robotics. The controller implements timestep integration
that can be used in discretized time regulators.

Documentation is `here <https://robo-pid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

To use the toolkit, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console
