Installation
------------

To use this project, first install it using **pip**:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install robo-time

Note that the install requires **robo-base** to be installed first. This is usually flagged as a 
dependency when installing **robo-time** using **pip**. If not then manually install.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install robo-base

Also robotime requires python >= 3.x


To verify **robo-time** is installed run from the command line

.. code-block:: console

    $  python -m pip list | grep robo-
    robo-base                          0.1.4
    robo-time                          0.1.9
    robo-utils                         0.2.7

The output should be something similar with a minimal of
**robo-base** and **robo-time** listed
